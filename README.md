# PMCommands
PMCommands is a library designed to simplify the creation and registration of custom Minecraft commands on PaperMC. It automates much of the boilerplate, letting you focus on writing clean, developer-friendly command logic.

## ✨ Features

-    Simple & intuitive – minimal setup required

-    Automatic management – parses and registers commands for you

-    Annotation-driven – define commands with clear annotations

## ⚙️ Limitations

-    Only supports static methods

-    Commands must explicitly accept the command context

-    To add custom argument types (even if already available in PaperMC)

## 📂 Full Example

A complete working example can be found [here](https://github.com/Fairesss/PMCommands/tree/master/app/src/main/java/org/example).
